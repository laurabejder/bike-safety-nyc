# Bike safety in New York City

This is my first project data studios. The promp for this project was 'something you miss from home' and as a Dane, my mind went straight to biking. I was curious to how dangerous it is to bike in New York City and how it compares to my home town Copenhagen.

## Aim of the project
This project examines the bike safety and the condition of the bike infrastructure in New York City. It looks into the location and reasons for accidents that result in the injury or death of a cyclist and visually illustrate how the city has tried to improve bike safety by expanding its network of protected bike lanes.

## Findings
- Short description of your findings

## Data collection
- Summary of the data collection process, with links

- NYC bike lanes: [NYC Open Data, New York City Bike Routes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/New-York-City-Bike-Routes/7vsa-caz7#revert)
- Shape files of NYC: [The University of Texas at Austin, GeoData](https://geodata.lib.utexas.edu/?f%5Bdc_format_s%5D%5B%5D=Shapefile&f%5Bdct_spatial_sm%5D%5B%5D=New+York%2C+New+York%2C+United+States&per_page=50)
- Number of bike riders in NYC: [NYC DOT Cycling in the City](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/cyclinginthecity.shtml)

This repository also contains data on bike accidents in Copenhagen. This data isn't included in the article because it wasn't possible to properly standardize it by number of bike riders and thus make it comparable to New York City.
